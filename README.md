Extracting data from OSM database

I have been updating Open Street Maps with all the house names in my village (because couriers keep knocking on my door and saying "Do you know where XYZ is?").

Now that I've finished, I need to extract that information from the OSM so that it can be easily used.

The python file represents my attempts to do this (successfully so far).
